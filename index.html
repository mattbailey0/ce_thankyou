Over the last five years, you helped Citizen Effect raise $1 million from over 6,000 donors in support of 75 amazing nonprofit partners. That effort improved the lives of 350,000 people around the world. From a single well in India to tutoring in Detroit, Citizen Effect was an organization dedicated to transforming passionate people into effective community leaders and fundraisers.
			</p>
			<p>
Citizen Effect's success stemmed from a few sources: dedicated Citizen Philanthropists, passionate nonprofit partners and a powerful technology platform that connected them both. We are extremely proud of our Citizen Philanthropists, thankful of our nonprofit partners and in awe of the enabling nature of the right technology. 
			</p>
			<p>
With all that in mind, we at Citizen Effect have made an important strategic decision. Rather than facilitate and manage projects ourselves, requiring a costly infrastructure and keeping a valuable tool behind closed doors, we are excited to announce that in May we will be open sourcing our code base, making it freely available to everyone. So while Citizen Effect will be going away as an organization, our platform will live on and be available for you to study, test and deploy. If you are interested in joining this open source project, please email <a href="mailto:open@citizeneffect.org" class="medblue">open@citizeneffect.org</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>
We hope you will carry on Citizen Effect's mission of empowering everyday citizens to improve communities, whether down the road or across the globe. And we challenge you to take our platform and do the most good with it you possibly can.
			</p>
			<p>
So many people made Citizen Effect possible. We cannot name everyone, but you all know who you are. It would mean the world to us if you <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CitizenEffect" class="medblue">visited Facebook one last time and told us about your favorite Citizen Effect memory</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
From our family to yours, thank you for all of your support.
			</p>
			<p>

Sincerely,
